# Youtube-TacoShopProject
A simple HTML website called "Little Taco Shop," built by following the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube tutorial. It demonstrates basic HTML5 elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and links. Includes sections such as About Us, Menu, Store Hours, and Contact to simulate a taco shop's online presence.
